### One Line Summary

* "A Cochrane meta-analysis updated in 2015 showed that 'antibiotics were not very useful for most children with AOM'. It doesn't reduce pain or long term effects like hearing loss."

### Why is this study important?

* There are **tons of studies** on antibiotics and AOM in high powered journals **with conflicting results**. In fact, a big one with 300 patients [in 2011 in the New England Journal][NEJM] showed to the opposite conclusion to this article. But, **this is a meta-analysis**, which is the best form of evidence. Cochrane's known for high quality reviews and updates their articles regularly. It was **updated in 2015**.
* The original article was published in 2004. It's been [cited](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=16813170742658441819) [>500](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=13995223531602721090) times.

### Study Design

* Study Type: Meta-analysis
* Population: 13 trials. 3401 children from 2 months to 15 years old. All in high-income countries.
