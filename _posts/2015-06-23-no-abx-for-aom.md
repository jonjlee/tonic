### Quick Reference

* "A Cochrane meta-analysis updated in 2015 showed that 'antibiotics were not very useful for most children with AOM'. It doesn't reduce pain or long term effects like hearing loss."

### Caveats

### Why is this study important?

* There have been tons of studies on antibiotics and AOM published in high powered journals with conflicting results. A big one with 300 patient [in 2011 in the New England Journal][NEJM] showed to the opposite conclusion. This study is a meta-analysis, which is the best form of evidence, and it was updated in 2015. Cochrane's known for high quality reviews and updates their articles regularly.
