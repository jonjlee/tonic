### Quick Reference

* "A number of studies have shown that most ALTEs don't result in bad outcomes and don't need to be admitted. A 2 year study at CHOP with 300 cases is one of the bigger studies. It confirmed the same thing and gives an algorithm to identify kids that probably don't need admission."
* "One of the bigger ALTE studies from CHOP in 2012 showed that less than 20% of their ALTE admissions are warranted."
* "One of the bigger ALTE studies from CHOP in 2012 showed that observed activity during the ALTE, CPR, duration of the event, and family history of ALTE or SIDS don't correlate with bad outcomes."
* "There's an algorithm from CHOP for ALTEs that says there's a high probability that a kid doesn't need to be admitted if they: 1) were born at term and didn't turn blue; 2) were term, did turned blue, but was choking at the time and now looks normal on exam; or 3) were premature but also have URI symptoms."
