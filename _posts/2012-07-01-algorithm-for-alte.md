### Quick Reference

One of the bigger ALTE studies from CHOP in 2012 showed that:

* **most ALTEs don't result in bad outcomes**. Other smaller studies say the same thing.
* less than 20% of their ALTE admissions are warranted.
* these signs you intuitively worry about don't  actually correlate with bad outcomes: observed activity during the ALTE, CPR, duration of the event, and family history of ALTE or SIDS.
* **you probably shouldn't admit the kid** if they: 1) were born at term and didn't turn blue; 2) were term, did turned blue, but was choking at the time and now looks normal on exam; or 3) were premature but also have URI symptoms.

### Caveats

* This applies to infants < 12 yo.
* A few kids who needed intervention were missed. So, use the algorithm as one of many inputs for your decision making.
* There were no cases of abuse, so the algorithm wouldn't account for it.
* This is a one-center study over 2 years. The algorithm isn't ready to be used universally.

### What is the full clinical decision rule they created?

Here's a summary of they're CDR in Figure 1. Gray squares mean the patient probably doesn't need to be admitted. In the paper, it's presented based on the actual data with number patients needing significant interventions in each class. So, keep in mind that this is an interpretation and simplification if you were inclined to apply it to your own patient.
