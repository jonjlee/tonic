### Quick Reference

* "The START trial - an international randomized controlled trial in 2003 - showed you should treat mild persistent asthma early with steroids because it reduces the number of exacerbations."

### Caveats

* The study only used budesonide. We need to look to other studies to prove that other steroids work too.
* No dosing guidelines are given in this study.
* Steroids have a small effect on growth.

#### What does START stand for?

"Steroid Treatment as Regular Therapy". The study design and rationale is described in a [separate paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11514041).
