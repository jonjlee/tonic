### One Line Summary

* A consensus published in 2013 representing 12 large hospitals established propanolol as the standard treatment for complicated hemangiomas (impair eyes or airway, disfiguring, or ulcerating).

### Why just a consensus statement?

* This article is important because it's the original one that got everyone to start using propanolol.
* Dr. Léauté-Labrèze originally proposed using propanolol in a [NEJM letter to the editor](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc0708819#t=article).
* The same doctor published a randomized trial in 2015 with 460 patients. It's [free on the NEJM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18550886).

### What hospitals were represented?

* The first authors are from the Medical College of Wisconsin. Others include Northwestern, Indiana University, Children's National, Columbia, Gunderson Lutheran, Baylor, Hopkins, CHW, Seattle Children's, Birthmark Institute, Eastern Virginia Medical School, UCSF
