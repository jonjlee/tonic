<span class="written-logo">tonic</span> provides summaries of high impact publications in pediatrics. Our content is geared towards residents and medical students who need a quick reference of current evidence for rounds and details on how and when certain studies apply. The PCOS analysis method is used to dig into the study details for times when in depth discussion is needed.

## What this site is all about

* **Quick summaries** and one liners to quote during rounds.
* **Caveats** that show you understand what the article actually says and if it can be applied to your patient.
* **Rigorous analysis** using an EBM framework for when you need to sit down and dissect an article.
* **Community** driven discussions to share your ideas.

## Upcoming articles

Here are the articles in priority order that are scheduled to appear on this site:
