Article are also broken down using the PCOS method to highlight the study design for more in depth discussion.

## What this site is all about

* **Quick summaries** and one liners to use during rounds.
* **Caveats** that show you understand what the article actually says and if it can be applied to your patient.
* **Rigorous analysis** using an EBM framework for when you need to sit down and dissect an article.
* **Community** driven discussions to share your ideas.
